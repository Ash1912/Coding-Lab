// Write a C or C++ program to perform sufferage heuristic on virtual machines and tasks by taking the input from the user and also calculate the completion time of each task with explaination.
// 1)For each task find the difference between minimum and second minimum completion time over all the task.
// 2)Find the maximum sufferage/difference over all the task.
// 3)Assign the task to the machine which gives the minimum sufferage completion time.
// 4)Repeat the procedure until all task are scheduled.
